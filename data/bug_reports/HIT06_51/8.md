#### ***Description***
There is a potential issue at line 258 of script HIT06\_51, specifically related to the method invocations **add** and **toString**. The problem seems to originate from an **if** statement at line 19, where a char variable named **c** is compared to the string **"//"**. This comparison uses the **==** operator, which is not appropriate for string comparison. Additionally, there are concerns regarding the **assertEquals** call in the test, which might not be functioning as intended due to a lack of familiarity with the method. These issues combined might be contributing to the observed failure.
#### ***2. Steps to Reproduce***
1. Review the **if** statement at line 19 to understand the incorrect use of the **==** operator in comparing a char variable **c** with a string **"//"**.
1. Analyze the use of **assertEquals** in the relevant unit test to identify any potential misunderstandings or incorrect implementations.
1. Observe the behavior of the script at line 258, particularly focusing on the method invocations **add** and **toString**, and how they interact with the earlier faulty comparison.
#### ***3. Expected Result***
The script should correctly compare character and string values using an appropriate method for string comparison. The **assertEquals** method in the unit test should be correctly implemented to validate the expected outcomes accurately.
#### ***4. Actual Result***
Currently, there is an incorrect comparison between a char and a string using **==**. This, combined with potential issues in the implementation of **assertEquals**, might be leading to the failure or unexpected behavior in the script.
