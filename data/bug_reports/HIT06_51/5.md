#### ***Description***
The issue in the script HIT06\_51 relates to the use or definition of the variable **x**, specifically concerning its data type. Currently, **x** is of type **double**, which is problematic in this context because **0.0** and **-0.0** are considered equal in **double** type. However, for accurate string representation, distinguishing between **0.0** and **-0.0** is necessary. Therefore, using a **Double** object rather than a primitive **double** type would be more appropriate, as it would allow for the distinct handling of **0.0** and **-0.0** and ensure proper conversion and representation in the string.
#### ***2. Steps to Reproduce***
1. Assign values **0.0** and **-0.0** to the variable **x**, which is of type **double**.
1. Execute the script and observe how **x** is processed and converted into a string representation.
1. Compare the outcomes to verify if **0.0** and **-0.0** are indistinguishably processed and represented due to the **double** type.
#### ***3. Expected Result***
The variable **x** should allow for a distinct and accurate representation of **0.0** and **-0.0** in string format, which necessitates a data type that can differentiate between these two values.
#### ***4. Actual Result***
Due to the use of the **double** type for variable **x**, **0.0** and **-0.0** are treated as equivalent, leading to an inability to differentiate between these two values in string representation. This lack of distinction likely contributes to the failure observed in the unit test or incorrect behavior of the script.
