#### ***Description***
There is an issue concerning the use or definition of the variable **prev** in the script HIT06\_51. The problem arises from the variable's name "prev", which is intended to represent the final character of a string but is ambiguously named "last". This misleading naming convention could lead to confusion and erroneous code interpretation or implementation, potentially contributing to the failure observed in the unit test.
#### ***2. Steps to Reproduce***
1. Review the source code to understand the implementation and usage of the variable **prev**.
1. Analyze the context in which **prev** is supposed to represent the final character of a string.
1. Identify any instances where the ambiguous naming of **prev** as "last" might lead to misinterpretation or incorrect application in the code.
#### ***3. Expected Result***
The variable **prev** should be clearly and accurately named to reflect its purpose and usage in the code, avoiding any ambiguity. Its role as representing the final character of a string should be evident and unambiguous to maintain code clarity and correct functionality.
#### ***4. Actual Result***
Currently, the variable **prev** is ambiguously named as "last", leading to potential confusion and incorrect interpretations in the code. This misnomer might be contributing to the failure observed in the unit test, as the variable's intended purpose is not clearly communicated through its name.
