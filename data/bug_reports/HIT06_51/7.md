#### ***Description***
The issue at line 260 of the script HIT06\_51 involves the method invocations **add** and **toString**. The problem arises when attempting to represent **-0.0** as a string. In the code, the **add** method is called with **Long.toString(value)** as its argument. However, since **value** was previously a **long** type, it cannot represent **-0** as it inherently lacks a sign for zero. This discrepancy leads to a failure to return the expected **[-0.]** string, potentially causing the observed failure in the unit test or other parts of the script.
#### ***2. Steps to Reproduce***
1. Assign the value **-0.0** to a variable of type **long** and pass it to the **add** method at line 260.
1. Execute the script and observe the output or behavior at this specific line, particularly the string representation generated by **Long.toString(value)**.
1. Verify whether the output string accurately represents **[-0.]** or incorrectly shows a different value due to the limitations of the **long** type.
#### ***3. Expected Result***
The expected behavior is for the script to correctly handle and represent the value **-0.0** as **[-0.]** in the string, even when converted from a **long** type.
#### ***4. Actual Result***
In practice, due to the **long** data type's inability to represent signed zero, the value **-0.0** is not correctly converted into the expected **[-0.]** string. This likely leads to incorrect behavior or output in the script.
