#### ***1. Description***
An issue has been identified at line 260 in the script HIT06\_51, specifically related to the method invocations **add** and **toString**. The problem occurs when the **add(Long.toString(value));** statement is executed. Here, the variable **value**, which is of type **long**, is supposed to represent **-0.0**. However, due to the nature of the **long** data type, the decimal portion **.0** is discarded, and the negative zero **-0** is automatically converted to **0** by the compiler. Consequently, instead of appending **-0.0** to the string, **0** is appended, leading to an incorrect output.
#### ***2. Steps to Reproduce***
1. Assign the value **-0.0** to the variable **value** which is of type **long**.
1. Execute the script up to line 260 where **add(Long.toString(value));** is called.
1. Observe the output or the state of the string after the **add** method is invoked.
#### ***3. Expected Result***
The expected behavior is for the method invocation at line 260 to correctly handle and represent the value **-0.0**, appending it as such to the string.
#### ***4. Actual Result***
In practice, due to the **long** data type of the **value** variable, **-0.0** is converted to **0**. As a result, **0** is appended to the string instead of the intended **-0.0**, leading to incorrect behavior or output in the script.
