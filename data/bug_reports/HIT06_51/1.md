#### ***1. Description***
There is a potential issue within the conditional clause between lines 247 and 264 of the script HIT06\_51. This problem is suspected to be related to a recent failure in a unit test. The specific nature of the issue is not fully understood, as the test case itself was not clear. However, since the majority of processing occurs within this code block, it is believed that the cause of the test failure might be located here.
#### ***2. Steps to Reproduce***
1. Execute the unit test that failed, ensuring the environment and data conditions are the same as during the failure.
1. Observe the behavior of the script, particularly focusing on the execution of the conditional clause between lines 247 and 264.
1. Record any errors or unexpected behaviors that occur within this block of code.
#### ***3. Expected Result***
The conditional clause in the script should process the input data correctly and pass the unit test without errors or unexpected behaviors.
#### ***4. Actual Result***
The actual result is currently unclear due to the lack of understanding of the test case. However, it is suspected that an error or an unexpected behavior occurs within the conditional clause between lines 247 and 264, leading to the failure of the unit test.
