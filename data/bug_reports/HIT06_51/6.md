#### ***Description***
There is a potential issue in the script HIT06\_51 related to the use or definition of the variable **x**. The concern centers around the compatibility and conversion between **double** and **long** types. While **double** and **long** may appear similar in certain contexts, they are inherently different in how they represent and handle data. Specifically, the issue might arise from the conversion process of a **double** to a **long** type, which could be problematic or not allowed in the given context. This type conversion issue could be contributing to the failure encountered.
#### ***2. Steps to Reproduce***
1. Investigate the occurrences where variable **x** of type **double** is being converted or used as a **long**.
1. Examine the script to identify any potential issues arising from this conversion, such as data loss or type incompatibility errors.
1. Note any failures or unexpected behaviors that occur due to this type conversion.
#### ***3. Expected Result***
The script should handle the type conversion from **double** to **long** correctly, without data loss, errors, or unexpected behavior, ensuring the intended functionality is preserved.
#### ***4. Actual Result***
The actual issue may involve improper or disallowed conversion from **double** to **long**, leading to unexpected behavior, errors, or the failure of the script to execute as intended.
