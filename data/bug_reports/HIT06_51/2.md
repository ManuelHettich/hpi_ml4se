#### ***Description***
There is a suspected issue in the conditional clause between lines 241 and 245 of the script HIT06\_51. This concern arises from a hypothesis that the failure in the unit test might be due to how the conditional clause handles a specific case. Specifically, if the variable being tested has a value of **-0.0** and the condition is checking for values less than zero, it might incorrectly interpret **-0.0** as less than zero, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.
#### ***2. Steps to Reproduce***
1. Set the variable in question to **-0.0**.
1. Run the unit test focusing on the behavior of the script, especially the conditional clause between lines 241 and 245.
1. Observe whether the condition incorrectly treats **-0.0** as a value less than zero, and note any resultant errors or deviations from expected behavior.
#### ***3. Expected Result***
The conditional clause should correctly identify **-0.0** as not less than zero and accordingly process it, ensuring the correct execution path in the script.
#### ***4. Actual Result***
The actual result is suspected to be an incorrect handling of the **-0.0** value by the conditional clause, potentially misinterpreting it as less than zero, which may lead to a failure in the unit test or unexpected script behavior.
