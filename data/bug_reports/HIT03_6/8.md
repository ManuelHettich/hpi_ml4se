#### ***Description***
In the script, there seems to be a potential issue with the use or definition of the variable "input" that might be contributing to the observed failure. Specifically, the problem arises when attempting to return a character from the CharSequence "input" at a certain index. The exception occurs due to an attempt to access a character position that does not exist within the bounds of "input", akin to trying to retrieve the char at position 5 in a CharSequence that is only 2 characters long.
#### ***Steps to Reproduce***
1. **Review "input" Variable**: Examine how the "input" CharSequence is defined and used throughout the script, especially in relation to its length.
1. **Trace Access Attempts**: Follow the points in the code where characters from "input" are accessed, particularly noting any pattern or logic that might lead to accessing beyond its length.
1. **Identify Access Error**: Pinpoint the specific instances or conditions under which the script tries to access a character position in "input" that exceeds its actual length, leading to the exception.
#### ***Expected Result***
The script should ensure that all character access attempts on "input" are within its valid range. This involves not only correct initial definition and handling of "input" but also appropriate checks or safeguards whenever "input" is accessed throughout the script.
#### ***Actual Result***
The script likely attempts to access a character position in "input" that exceeds its length, causing an exception. This might be due to a logical error in handling "input" size or a failure to appropriately check indices before access, especially in parts of the script where "input" length is critical. Identifying and correcting the specific missteps in handling and accessing "input" is crucial to resolving the failure.
