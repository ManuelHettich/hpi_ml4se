#### ***1) Description:***
The issue is related to the method invocations **charCount** and **codePointAt** at line 95. A critical aspect of this issue is the increment of the **pos** counter, which occurs in line 89 and again in line 95 within the while loop. This double incrementation could potentially cause **pos** to exceed the length of the string held in the **len** variable, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or other unintended behaviors.
#### ***2) Steps to Reproduce:***
1. Execute the script **HIT03\_6**.
1. Examine the while loop, especially focusing on the incrementation of **pos** at lines 89 and 95.
1. Observe the behavior when **pos** is incremented twice within the loop, particularly checking if it surpasses the length of the string defined by **len**.
#### ***3) Expected Result:***
The **pos** counter should be incremented in a controlled manner, ensuring it never exceeds the boundary set by the **len** variable. The methods **charCount** and **codePointAt** should function correctly without causing **pos** to go out of bounds, thus preventing any string index out-of-range errors.
#### ***4) Actual Result:***
Currently, the double incrementation of **pos** in the loop (lines 89 and 95) may result in **pos** exceeding the length defined by **len**. This could lead to index out-of-bound errors or other unexpected behaviors during the script's execution.
