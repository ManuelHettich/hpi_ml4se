#### ***Description***
There appears to be a potential issue with the while-loop between lines 84 and 97 in the script, specifically concerning its handling of character lengths in variable-width encoding such as UTF-8. The loop's logic seems to be aimed at handling characters that may be one or two bytes long. The suspected issue arises from the for-loop on line 94, where the variable **pt** is incremented and compared against **consumed** while accessing **input** via the **pos** variable. If **consumed** is initially 0, **pos** is incremented on line 89 and continues to increment at a rate disproportionate to the characters consumed from **input**. This leads to a situation where **pos** may surpass the length of **input**, potentially causing an error when attempting to access **input** at an index beyond its bounds.
#### ***Steps to Reproduce***
1. **Execution**: Execute the script and observe the behavior of the while-loop between lines 84 and 97.
1. **Monitoring Variables**: Pay close attention to the increments of **pos** and **pt**, and their relation to **consumed**.
1. **Identify Error Condition**: Look for scenarios where **consumed** is greater than zero and **pos** exceeds the length of **input**, leading to a potential out-of-bounds error on line 95.
#### ***Expected Result***
The while-loop should correctly handle variable-length characters, incrementing **pos** and **pt** appropriately to ensure safe access within the bounds of **input**. The loop should account for different character lengths and adjust increments in a manner that prevents **pos** from overshooting the length of **input**.
#### ***Actual Result***
The script likely encounters an error due to **pos** being incremented at a rate faster than the characters are consumed from **input**, especially when **consumed** is greater than zero. This disproportionate increment rate might result in **pos** exceeding the length of **input**, leading to an attempt to access **input** beyond its bounds and consequently raising an error. The exact conditions and behavior leading to this issue need to be identified and corrected.
