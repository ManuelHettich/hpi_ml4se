#### ***Description***
The method invocation of **Character.codePointAt** at line 87 in the script may be causing an issue due to the potential of an out-of-bounds access. This problematic access is suspected to be related to the variable "pos" being incremented on line 89 inside the while loop. If "pos" exceeds the length of the CharSequence it is indexing, it may lead to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException or similar error, disrupting the normal flow and functionality of the code.
#### ***Steps to Reproduce***
1. **Examine Line 87**: Review the invocation of **Character.codePointAt** particularly how it uses the "pos" variable as an index.
1. **Trace "pos" Variable**: Follow the incrementation and usage of "pos" throughout the while loop, especially how it's incremented on line 89.
1. **Identify Out-of-Bounds Potential**: Determine the scenario where "pos" exceeds the bounds of the CharSequence leading to a potential error when accessed by **codePointAt**.
#### ***Expected Result***
The script should maintain the "pos" variable within the bounds of the CharSequence it indexes, ensuring that every access by **Character.codePointAt** is valid. This includes implementing necessary checks or controls on the incrementation of "pos" to prevent any out-of-bounds access.
#### ***Actual Result***
The current implementation likely allows "pos" to increment beyond the bounds of the CharSequence it is meant to index, particularly after repeated increments inside the while loop. This leads to an out-of-bounds attempt when accessed by **Character.codePointAt** at line 87, potentially causing an error or exception and contributing to the failure observed in the script. The exact conditions under which "pos" exceeds the CharSequence length and how it impacts the script's execution need to be identified and corrected.
