#### ***1) Description:***
The issue seems to be associated with the While-loop between lines 84 and 97, where character counts are referenced. The connection to the failure seems to be closely related to being out of range, as indicated by the error. A critical observation is that the character count, possibly expected to be 0, might be causing the error. This suggests a possible miscalculation or mismanagement of character counts within the loop, potentially leading to an out-of-range error.
#### ***2) Steps to Reproduce:***
1. Execute the script **HIT03\_6**.
1. Focus on the execution of the While-loop between lines 84 and 97, with particular attention to how character counts are handled and calculated.
1. Observe the conditions under which the character count might become 0, and how this relates to the overall behavior of the loop and any potential out-of-range errors.
#### ***3) Expected Result:***
The While-loop should accurately handle and calculate character counts, ensuring that they are within valid ranges and correctly processed. The loop should account for situations where the character count is 0, handling such scenarios without leading to range errors or other unexpected behavior.
#### ***4) Actual Result:***
Currently, there is a concern that the handling of character counts within this While-loop might be flawed, particularly in cases where the count is expected to be 0. This miscalculation or mismanagement could be contributing to the out-of-range error observed in the script.
