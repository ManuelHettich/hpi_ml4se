#### ***) Description:***
The issue appears to be centered around the While-loop between lines 84 and 97. This section of the code is suspected to be the source of a **StringIndexOutOfBoundsException** error. The error message "String index out of range: 2" suggests that the variable **pos** may be exceeding the bounds of the **input** string. During each iteration of the loop, **pos** is incremented, but if it is already at the end of **input**, any further increment could render **pos** invalid. This would lead to a **StringIndexOutOfBoundsException** as the loop tries to access a position outside the string's range.
#### ***2) Steps to Reproduce:***
1. Execute script **HIT03\_6**.
1. Pay special attention to the While-loop execution between lines 84 and 97.
1. Monitor the values of **pos** and the length of **input** string during each iteration of the loop, particularly when **pos** approaches the end of **input**.
#### ***3) Expected Result:***
The While-loop should safely iterate over the **input** string without causing an out-of-bounds exception. It should correctly handle scenarios where **pos** reaches the end of **input**, either by terminating the loop or managing the boundary condition in a way that prevents the exception.
#### ***4) Actual Result:***
The current behavior suggests that the While-loop does not adequately handle the condition where **pos** reaches or exceeds the length of **input**. This leads to a **StringIndexOutOfBoundsException**, particularly when **pos** is incremented beyond the valid range of **input**.
