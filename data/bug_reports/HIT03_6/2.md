#### ***Description***
The script **HIT03\_6** encounters a potential issue in the for-loop between lines 94 and 96, likely leading to an application crash. The problem seems to stem from the incrementation of the **pos** variable by a value associated with **input**. This incrementation continues while an unrelated condition (**pt < consumed**) holds true. It is suspected that this behavior might cause an out-of-bounds operation on **input**, leading to a **StringIndexOutOfBoundsException**.
#### ***Steps to Reproduce***
1. Execute the script **HIT03\_6**.
1. Observe the behavior of the for-loop between lines 94 and 96, especially how **pos** increments in relation to **input** and the condition **pt < consumed**.
1. Continue execution until the **StringIndexOutOfBoundsException** occurs, noting if it relates to the suspected out-of-bounds access on **input**.
#### ***Expected Result***
The for-loop should safely iterate through the **input** without causing an out-of-bounds access. The **pos** variable should increment correctly and terminate the loop when the end of the **input** is reached or when the **pt < consumed** condition is no longer true.
#### ***Actual Result***
The program likely crashes with a **StringIndexOutOfBoundsException**, indicating that the **pos** variable possibly exceeds the bounds of **input**. This is inferred to be due to the incrementation logic in line 95 and the unrelated loop termination condition. The exact mechanism and condition leading to the exception need to be identified and addressed.
