#### ***1) Description:***
The issue appears to be with the error handling approach used in the conditional clause between lines 76 and 78. The current implementation utilizes the "throws" keyword, which may not be the most effective way to handle faulty input in this context. The absence of try-catch blocks suggests that the code does not actively manage exceptions that may arise from invalid input, potentially leading to unhandled exceptions and failure in error propagation.
#### ***2) Steps to Reproduce:***
1. Run the script **HIT03\_6**.
1. Review the implementation of the conditional clause between lines 76 and 78.
1. Observe the behavior of the script in scenarios with faulty or unexpected input, particularly noting if any exceptions are unhandled or improperly propagated.
#### ***3) Expected Result:***
The script should robustly handle faulty input through appropriate error handling mechanisms. The use of try-catch blocks in place of or alongside "throws" would allow for more controlled management of exceptions, enabling the script to deal with errors in a more predictable and safe manner.
#### ***4) Actual Result:***
In its current state, the script potentially fails to adequately handle exceptions due to the use of the "throws" keyword without accompanying try-catch blocks. This could lead to unmanaged exceptions when encountering faulty input, causing the script to behave unpredictably or crash.
