#### ***1) Description:***
The issue appears to be related to the **write** method invocation at line 88. The function is responsible for writing out a string, which could potentially lead to errors if the index used in the process is negative, exceeds, or in some cases, is equal to the size of the string. This might cause unexpected behavior or an error in the output.
#### ***2) Steps to Reproduce:***
1. Execute the script **HIT03\_6**.
1. Reach the process where the **write** method is invoked at line 88.
1. Observe the behavior when the method attempts to write a string, especially focusing on cases where the index might be negative, greater than, or equal to the length of the string.
#### ***3) Expected Result:***
The **write** method should correctly handle string outputs without causing any errors, irrespective of the index values relative to the string size. It should either write the string successfully or handle erroneous index values gracefully without crashing or producing incorrect outputs.
#### ***4) Actual Result:***
Currently, the **write** method may not be handling certain index values correctly, particularly when the index is negative, greater than, or equal to the size of the string. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the script's output.
