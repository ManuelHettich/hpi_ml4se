#### ***Description***
There might be an issue with the use or definition of the variable "c" in the script, particularly in relation to its interaction with the **codePointAt** method. The method **codePointAt** will throw a **java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException** if the "pos" index is negative or not less than the length of the input. The issue appears to manifest when "pos" equals 2, which suggests that "c" might be involved in or affected by these improper index conditions, leading to the observed failure.
#### ***Steps to Reproduce***
1. **Review the "c" Variable**: Examine the definition and use of the variable "c", especially where it's involved with or influenced by the **codePointAt** method.
1. **Trace "pos" Index Conditions**: Follow the changes and conditions of the "pos" variable throughout the script, noting particularly the instance or instances when "pos" equals 2.
1. **Identify Error Conditions**: Determine the circumstances under which "pos" leads to an inappropriate index for **codePointAt**, causing a **java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException**, and how these conditions relate to the use or definition of "c".
#### ***Expected Result***
The script should correctly handle the "pos" variable to ensure it is always a valid index when used with **codePointAt** or any similar methods. This includes ensuring "pos" is never negative and always less than the length of the input, thereby preventing any out-of-bounds exceptions and maintaining the proper functionality of the variable "c".
#### ***Actual Result***
The script might be allowing "pos" to reach an invalid index condition, particularly when "pos" equals 2, causing the **codePointAt** method to throw a **java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException**. This improper index handling likely affects or is related to the variable "c", leading to the failure. The exact mechanics of how "c" is involved and the conditions under which "pos" becomes inappropriate need to be thoroughly investigated and rectified to resolve the issue.
