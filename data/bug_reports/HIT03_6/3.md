#### ***Description***
In the script in question, there appears to be a potential issue with the use or definition of the variable "consumed" that might be related to the observed failure. The concern is that if the "translate" function, which presumably contributes to defining "consumed", throws an IllegalArgumentException, the system might be attempting to define "consumed" (an integer) using an erroneous string value. This could result in unexpected behavior or failures within the script.
#### ***Steps to Reproduce***
1. Trace the definition and usage of the "consumed" variable within the script, especially where it interacts with the "translate" function.
1. Observe the behavior of the script and the "translate" function to identify any instances where an IllegalArgumentException might be thrown.
1. Check if, following such an exception, the script attempts to define or use the "consumed" variable with invalid data, leading to further errors or undefined behavior.
#### ***Expected Result***
The "consumed" variable should be defined and used correctly throughout the script, handling any exceptions from the "translate" function gracefully. The system should ensure that "consumed" remains a valid integer throughout its lifecycle and that no illegal assignments or conversions occur.
#### ***Actual Result***
The script might be failing due to an improper handling or definition of the "consumed" variable, particularly if an IllegalArgumentException occurs during the execution of the "translate" function. This could lead to attempts at assigning or using "consumed" inappropriately, contributing to the failure observed. Identifying the exact nature of the misuse and the conditions under which it occurs is crucial to resolving the issue.
