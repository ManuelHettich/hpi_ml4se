#### ***Description***
In the script, there may be an issue with the method invocation of **length** at line 83 that could be contributing to the observed failure. The problem is suspected to stem from the variable "len" being set too high, which in turn causes the while loop to execute more iterations than intended. This excessive iteration count likely results in the "pos" code pointer going out of bounds by the time execution reaches line 87, particularly affecting the use of variables or methods like **Character.codePointAt** that rely on "pos" being within the valid range.
#### ***Steps to Reproduce***
1. **Examine Line 83**: Review how "len" is determined and set by the **length** method invocation.
1. **Trace "len" and "pos"**: Follow the usage of "len" in controlling the while loop and how "pos" is incremented within this loop.
1. **Identify Loop Termination Issue**: Determine if "len" is indeed set too high, causing the while loop to run extra iterations and consequently pushing "pos" beyond the valid bounds by the time it's used at line 87.
#### ***Expected Result***
The "len" variable should be set to an appropriate value that accurately reflects the length of the relevant data structure, ensuring the while loop executes the correct number of iterations. This proper setting should prevent "pos" from going out of bounds and maintain the integrity of index-dependent method invocations like **Character.codePointAt**.
#### ***Actual Result***
The script might be setting "len" too high, likely due to a misinterpretation or miscalculation at line 83. This incorrect length setting causes the while loop to over-iterate, pushing "pos" beyond the intended limit and leading to out-of-bounds access attempts, particularly noted at line 87. This misalignment between "len", the while loop's execution, and "pos" incrementation needs to be identified and corrected to resolve the failure.
