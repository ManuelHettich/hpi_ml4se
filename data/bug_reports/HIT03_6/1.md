**1) Description**

In the script identified as "HIT03\_6", there appears to be an issue with the method invocations **charCount** and **codePointAt** at line 95. The problem arises when the **codePointAt** method returns a Unicode character value greater than 0x10000. In such cases, the **charCount** method returns 2. This return value is potentially added to the variable **pos**, leading to the creation of an index value larger than the string length, which is not the intended behavior.

**2) Steps to Reproduce**

1. Navigate to the script "HIT03\_6".
1. Execute the function or method that includes the **charCount** and **codePointAt** method invocations at line 95.
1. Input or encounter a string that causes **codePointAt** to return a Unicode character value greater than 0x10000.

**3) Expected Result**

The methods **charCount** and **codePointAt** should handle Unicode character values correctly, even those greater than 0x10000, without creating an index value larger than the string length or causing any out-of-bounds errors.

**4) Actual Result**

When **codePointAt** returns a Unicode character value greater than 0x10000, the **charCount** method returns 2. This value is added to **pos**, creating an index that is potentially larger than the string length, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.
