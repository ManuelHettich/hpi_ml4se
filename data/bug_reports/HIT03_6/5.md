#### ***Description***
In the script, there is a potential issue with the method invocation(s) "toChars, codePointAt" at line 87 that might be contributing to the observed failure. The concern centers around the lack of bounds checking before calling **codePointAt()**. Without ensuring the index is within the bounds of the string, the method might be called with an invalid index, leading to an error similar to receiving a NaN from **charCodeAt()** in JavaScript. This issue could complicate the execution and behavior of the subsequent code.
#### ***Steps to Reproduce***
1. **Review Line 87**: Look at the specific implementation and invocation of **toChars** and **codePointAt** methods on line 87.
1. **Check Index Validity**: Verify if there is a precondition check that ensures the index is within the bounds of the string before invoking **codePointAt()**.
1. **Observe Error Propagation**: Note how a lack of bounds checking could lead to further complications and errors in the code following line 87.
#### ***Expected Result***
Before invoking **codePointAt()**, the script should include a check to ensure the index is within the valid range of the string. This safeguard would prevent errors related to out-of-bounds access and ensure the subsequent code operates on valid data.
#### ***Actual Result***
The script might be invoking **codePointAt()** without ensuring the index is within the bounds of the string, leading to potential errors and undefined behavior in the code execution. This oversight can result in failure cases similar to encountering a NaN in JavaScript when an index is out of bounds. The code needs to be reviewed and possibly refactored to include necessary bounds checking to prevent these errors.
