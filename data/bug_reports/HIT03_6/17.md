#### ***1) Description:***
The issue appears to be centered around the While-loop between lines 84 and 97, which involves operations with arrays and array indexes. Given that this is the only section in the script where array usage and index manipulation are prominent, there is a high likelihood that the observed failure is related to this part of the code. Potential issues could include improper handling of array indexes, boundary issues, or incorrect manipulation of array elements.
#### ***2) Steps to Reproduce:***
1. Execute the script **HIT03\_6**.
1. Focus on the execution of the While-loop between lines 84 and 97, particularly observing the handling of arrays and their indexes.
1. Monitor for any signs of array index out-of-bounds errors, improper array manipulation, or other anomalies related to array operations.
#### ***3) Expected Result:***
The While-loop should correctly and safely handle array operations, including proper index management. The script should account for all possible array boundaries and conditions, ensuring that all array accesses are within valid ranges and that array elements are manipulated correctly.
#### ***4) Actual Result:***
There is a possibility that the script is not correctly handling arrays and their indexes within this While-loop, which could lead to errors such as array index out-of-bounds, improper array element manipulation, or other related issues.
