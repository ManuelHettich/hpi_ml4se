#### ***1) Description:***
The issue appears to involve the variable **c**, which is populated with the character returned from the **codePointAt** method. While **c** itself may not be directly causing the error, its connection to the **codePointAt** method, which is where the exception is occurring, is a significant aspect to consider. There may be concerns about how **c** is being used or the values it is receiving, especially if **codePointAt** is producing unexpected results or encountering boundary-related errors.
#### ***2) Steps to Reproduce:***
1. Run the script **HIT03\_6**.
1. Review the instances where the variable **c** is used, especially where it receives values from the **codePointAt** method.
1. Assess the behavior of the script in these instances, particularly focusing on the values obtained by **c** and how these interact with the rest of the script, especially in relation to the exception occurring in the **codePointAt** method.
#### ***3) Expected Result:***
The variable **c** should correctly receive and handle values from the **codePointAt** method. The script should ensure that **c** is populated with appropriate values that are within valid boundaries and do not lead to further exceptions or errors in the script.
#### ***4) Actual Result:***
There is a concern that the interaction between the variable **c** and the **codePointAt** method might be contributing to the exception, especially if **codePointAt** is encountering errors or returning unexpected values that **c** is not equipped to handle.
