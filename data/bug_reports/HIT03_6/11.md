#### ***1) Description:***
The issue under investigation is related to the **translate** method invocation at line 85. Traditionally, the **translate** method is known to accept a pair of statements, typically in the format of (x, y) or (top, left). However, in this instance, the method is being invoked with the parameters (input, pos, out). This deviation from the standard usage pattern may be leading to an error or unexpected behavior in the script.
#### ***2) Steps to Reproduce:***
1. Run the script **HIT03\_6**.
1. Focus on the execution flow reaching the **translate** method at line 85.
1. Pay close attention to the parameters passed to the **translate** method, which are (input, pos, out), and observe the behavior or output of the script at this point.
#### ***3) Expected Result:***
The **translate** method is expected to function correctly with the provided parameters, without causing any errors or anomalies in the script's execution. It should either successfully perform the translation as intended or manage any incompatible parameter formats gracefully.
#### ***4) Actual Result:***
There is a possibility that the **translate** method, when invoked with the parameters (input, pos, out), is not functioning as intended. This non-standard usage could be the source of errors or unexpected outcomes in the script.
