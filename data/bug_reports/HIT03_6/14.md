#### ***1) Description:***
The issue under investigation involves the While-loop between lines 84 and 97, where there is a potential risk of the loop becoming infinite if the array **c** is null. In Java, arrays can be of size 0, and if **c** is indeed null or uninitialized, the loop's termination condition might never be met, leading to an infinite loop situation.
#### ***2) Steps to Reproduce:***
1. Run the script **HIT03\_6**.
1. Focus on the execution of the While-loop between lines 84 and 97.
1. Test the behavior of the loop particularly when the array **c** is null or uninitialized, observing if the loop exits or continues indefinitely.
#### ***3) Expected Result:***
The While-loop should have a fail-safe mechanism to handle situations where the array **c** is null, thereby preventing the loop from becoming infinite. The loop should either terminate or handle the null array condition in a way that ensures the script's continued proper functioning.
#### ***4) Actual Result:***
Currently, there appears to be a risk that the While-loop could become infinite if the array **c** is null. This situation may lead to the script hanging or consuming excessive resources, as it enters an unbreakable loop.
