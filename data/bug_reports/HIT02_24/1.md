**1. Description:** Issue with method invocation "Color" at line 119 in script HIT02\_24. The method seems to malfunction or throw an error when it receives a negative number as an input. Specifically, the Color function is receiving a -0.5 value from the getPaint function, which it is not equipped to handle, leading to unexpected behavior or failure.

**2. Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Navigate to script HIT02\_24.
1. Proceed to line 119 where the "Color" function is invoked.
1. Observe the behavior when the function is passed a -0.5 value from the getPaint function.

**3. Expected Result:** The Color function should handle all input values robustly. If it is not designed to accept negative values, it should either throw a descriptive error or ignore the command without causing a failure in the system.

**4. Actual Result:** When the Color function is invoked with a -0.5 value from the getPaint function at line 119, it leads to a failure or unexpected behavior, indicating that the function cannot handle negative numbers as input. This suggests a lack of error handling or a logical error within the Color function when dealing with such values.
