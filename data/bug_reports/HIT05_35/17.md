·  **Description:** The issue at line 3290 involves the **copyArrayGrow1** method, which is returning an Object array. The script then attempts to cast this Object array into a String array, resulting in a cast exception. This suggests a type mismatch between the array returned by **copyArrayGrow1** and the expected String array type at line 3290, leading to the observed failure.

·  **Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Execute the script up to line 3290, focusing on the **copyArrayGrow1** method invocation.
1. Observe the type of array returned by **copyArrayGrow1**.
1. Monitor the script for any exceptions or errors when it attempts to cast the returned Object array into a String array.

·  **Expected Result:** The **copyArrayGrow1** method should return an array type that is compatible with the expected type in the script. If a String array is expected, the method should ensure that the returned array can be safely cast to a String array without causing type mismatch issues.

·  **Actual Result:** **copyArrayGrow1** returns an Object array, which the script then attempts to cast into a String array at line 3290. This results in a cast exception due to the type mismatch, indicating a problem in either the method's return type or the script's handling of the returned array.
