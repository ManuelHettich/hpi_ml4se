1. **Description:** The issue involves the **getClass** method invocation at line 3288. The method is not instantiating a String instance as perhaps expected in the script. Instead, it is returning a reference to an Object, which later leads to an error due to this type mismatch. This suggests that the script might be expecting a String instance, but the use of **getClass** results in an Object, causing subsequent failures.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   1. Execute the script up to line 3288, focusing on the **getClass** method invocation.
   1. Observe the type of instance returned by the **getClass** method.
   1. Monitor how this returned type (Object) is used later in the script and note any errors or exceptions that occur as a result.
1. **Expected Result:** The script should correctly handle the type returned by the **getClass** method, ensuring it aligns with the expected type for subsequent operations. If a String instance is expected, the method or subsequent logic should handle this requirement appropriately.
1. **Actual Result:** The **getClass** method is returning an Object type, which is not converted or handled as a String instance later in the script. This mismatch in expected type results in an error, indicating a problem in the script's handling of the type returned by **getClass**.
