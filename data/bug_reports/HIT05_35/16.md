·  **Description:** The issue is associated with the **getClass** method invocation at line 3288. When both arguments passed to the method are null, the script defaults to **Object.class**. This default behavior is problematic as it leads to an unsuccessful implicit cast from Object to String, causing a failure in the script. Additionally, simply defaulting to a String class would not address the underlying problem, as other types would still be problematic. The suggested solution is to throw an exception when both arguments are null, to prevent this kind of type mismatch.

·  **Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Execute the script up to line 3288, particularly focusing on the **getClass** method invocation.
1. Ensure that both arguments passed to the method are null.
1. Observe the script's behavior, especially the defaulting to **Object.class** and the subsequent attempt at implicit casting.

·  **Expected Result:** The script should have a robust handling mechanism for null arguments, ideally throwing an exception in cases where both arguments are null. This would prevent inappropriate type assignments and maintain the integrity of the script's type system.

·  **Actual Result:** When both arguments are null, the script defaults to **Object.class**, which leads to a failed implicit cast to String. This results in a failure in the script, indicating a lack of proper handling for null argument scenarios.
