1. **Description:** The issue concerns the conditional clause at line 3288, specifically the default return value of **Object.class**. This default does not necessarily align with the template parameters used in the script, potentially leading to an invalid upcast from the return of **copyArrayGrow1**. When **Object.class** is returned by default, it may not be compatible with the expected type defined by the template parameters, resulting in type mismatch and casting issues.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   1. Execute the script up to line 3288, focusing on the conditional clause.
   1. Ensure that the conditions lead to the default return value of **Object.class**.
   1. Observe the behavior of the script, especially in terms of how this return value interacts with the template parameters and the type expected from **copyArrayGrow1**.
1. **Expected Result:** The conditional clause should return a class type that is consistent with the template parameters, ensuring type compatibility and preventing any invalid upcasting issues. The default return value should align with the expected type for seamless integration into the script's logic.
1. **Actual Result:** The default return of **Object.class** from the conditional clause may not match the template parameters, leading to an invalid upcast. This mismatch in type expectations results in errors or unexpected behavior when integrating with the rest of the script, specifically the output from **copyArrayGrow1**.
