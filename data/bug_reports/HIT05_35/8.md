1. **Description:** The issue at line 3290 in the script involves the method invocation **copyArrayGrow1**, where **array** is passed as null. Consequently, the type of the new array is determined by **newArrayComponentType**, which is **Object.class**. This results in the method returning an array of Objects. However, there is a problem when the script attempts to cast this array of Objects into an array of Strings, which is not permissible and leads to a type casting error.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   1. Execute the script up to line 3290, where **copyArrayGrow1** is invoked with **array** as null.
   1. Observe the behavior of the method in terms of the type of array it returns, particularly noting that **newArrayComponentType** is **Object.class**.
   1. Monitor the script for any exceptions or errors when it attempts to cast the returned array of Objects into an array of Strings.
1. **Expected Result:** The method should handle null **array** inputs in a manner that is consistent with the expected array type. If the expected type is an array of Strings, the method should return an appropriately typed array to avoid casting errors.
1. **Actual Result:** The method returns an array of Objects due to the null **array** input and **newArrayComponentType** being **Object.class**. This array of Objects cannot be cast to an array of Strings, leading to a type casting error. This behavior deviates from the expected functioning of the method and causes the failure.
