1. **Description:** The issue appears to be with the method invocation **copyArrayGrow1** at line 3290. The method is being called with both parameters as null via **ArrayUtils.add()**, resulting in the creation of an Object array instead of a String array. However, the generic type **T** is specified as **String**, leading to a type mismatch when the method tries to cast the returned Object array into a String array. This type casting is disallowed and likely causes a runtime exception or erroneous behavior.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   1. Execute the script up to line 3290 where **ArrayUtils.add()** is called with null values.
   1. Observe the behavior of the **copyArrayGrow1** method, especially the type of array it returns.
   1. Monitor the script for any exceptions or errors when it attempts to cast the returned Object array into a String array.
1. **Expected Result:** The method **copyArrayGrow1** should correctly handle the type of array based on the generic type **T**. If **T** is **String**, the method should return a String array, even when null values are passed, to maintain type consistency and prevent casting errors.
1. **Actual Result:** The method returns an Object array when null values are passed, leading to a type mismatch when the script attempts to cast this Object array into a String array. This results in a casting error or other related issues, deviating from the expected and correct behavior.
