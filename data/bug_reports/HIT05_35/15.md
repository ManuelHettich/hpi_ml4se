1. **Description:** The issue revolves around the conditional clause at line 3288. Both the first and the nested conditional statements evaluate to false, resulting in the variable **type** being set to **Object.class**. This setting is potentially problematic, as the failure in the script is related to an attempt to cast an object to a string. The introduction of **Object.class** as the type, in this case, might be the source of the type mismatch and the subsequent failure.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   1. Execute the script up to line 3288, focusing on the conditional clause.
   1. Confirm that both the initial and nested conditional statements evaluate to false.
   1. Observe the assignment of **type** as **Object.class** and its implications in the subsequent script execution, particularly in relation to type casting.
1. **Expected Result:** The conditional clause should handle the type assignment in a way that aligns with the expected type for subsequent operations. If a string type is expected, the clause should not default to **Object.class** in cases where the conditions are false, to avoid type mismatches.
1. **Actual Result:** Due to both conditional statements being false, **type** is set to **Object.class**. This appears to introduce a type mismatch later in the script, particularly in an attempt to cast an object to a string, leading to the observed failure.
