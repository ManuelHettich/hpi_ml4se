·  **Description:** There seems to be a concern with the conditional clause at line 3288: **element != null ? element.getClass() : Object.class**. The issue arises when the **element** is null, leading to the clause returning **Object.class**. This behavior could be problematic, depending on the context and the expected handling of null values. If the subsequent logic expects a specific class type other than **Object.class**, this could lead to failures or unexpected behavior in the script.

·  **Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Execute the script **HIT05\_35**.
1. Reach the execution point at line 3288 where the conditional clause is evaluated.
1. Ensure that the **element** variable is null to trigger the condition leading to the return of **Object.class**.
1. Observe the script's behavior following this conditional evaluation, especially in contexts where a specific class type is expected.

·  **Expected Result:** The conditional clause should correctly handle both non-null and null cases for the **element**. If **element** is non-null, it should return its class; if null, it should return a class type that aligns with the expected logic of the script, which may or may not be **Object.class**.

·  **Actual Result:** When **element** is null, the clause returns **Object.class**, which may not be the intended or appropriate class type for subsequent operations. This could potentially lead to failures or mismatches in type expectations, especially in scenarios where a more specific class type is required.
