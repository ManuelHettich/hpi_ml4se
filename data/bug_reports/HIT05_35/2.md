·  **Description:** A potential issue has been identified in the conditional clause at line 3288, which might be related to a class cast exception. This line involves the retrieval of classes, and given the nature of the failure, it is suspected that the issue arises at this point in the script. The specific aspect of the conditional clause causing the issue is currently unclear, but its relation to the class cast exception suggests a problem with type compatibility or handling.

·  **Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Run the script **HIT05\_35**.
1. Reach the execution point at line 3288, where the conditional clause involving class retrieval is executed.
1. Monitor the script's behavior, focusing on any exceptions or errors that arise during or immediately after this line's execution.

·  **Expected Result:** The conditional clause at line 3288 should execute without any issues, correctly handling the retrieval and comparison of classes. The script should proceed without triggering any class cast exceptions or related errors.

·  **Actual Result:** The execution of this line is suspected to be linked to a class cast exception. This suggests a problem in how the conditional clause handles the types of variables or classes. The exact nature of the issue, whether it lies in the comparison logic, type retrieval, or another aspect of the clause, needs further investigation.
