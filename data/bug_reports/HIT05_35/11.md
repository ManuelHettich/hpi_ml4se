1. **Description:** The issue seems to arise from the **copyArrayGrow1** method invocation at line 3290, particularly regarding its handling of **null** values. In Java, **null** is not considered an object, but there appears to be an attempt to cast **null** as an object within the **copyArrayGrow1** function call. This misunderstanding or misapplication of Java's handling of **null** values could be contributing to the failure observed in the script.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   1. Execute the script up to line 3290, where the **copyArrayGrow1** method is invoked.
   1. Pay special attention to how **null** values are handled within this method invocation.
   1. Observe the script's behavior, particularly for any exceptions or errors that arise due to the treatment of **null** in this context.
1. **Expected Result:** The **copyArrayGrow1** method should handle **null** values appropriately, considering Java's specific treatment of **null**. If **null** is not meant to be treated as an object, the method should include logic to handle such cases without causing errors or exceptions.
1. **Actual Result:** There appears to be an issue with how **null** is treated within the **copyArrayGrow1** method invocation. The script might be attempting to cast **null** as an object, leading to errors or failures, given that **null** is not an object in Java.
