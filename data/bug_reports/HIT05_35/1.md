·  **Description:** There is a potential issue with the **getClass** method invocation at line 3288. The concern is that this could be leading to a class cast exception. The method is used to get the class of an element within an array. The problem might stem from the type of variable being used in this context, which may not be compatible or may be causing unexpected behavior during runtime.

·  **Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Execute the script **HIT05\_35**.
1. Reach the execution point at line 3288 where **getClass** is invoked on an element within an array.
1. Observe the behavior of the script during and after this method invocation.

·  **Expected Result:** The **getClass** method should correctly identify and return the class of the element within the array without causing any exceptions or errors, ensuring smooth execution of the script.

·  **Actual Result:** There is a suspicion that the invocation of **getClass** is leading to a class cast exception. This indicates a possible mismatch in the expected type of the variable or improper handling of the variable's type within the array. The exact behavior and the type of error, if any, need to be confirmed through further testing and investigation.
