1. **Description:** The issue appears to be related to the use or definition of the variable "newArray" in the context of handling null parameters. The current implementation fails to throw an **IllegalArgumentException** when both parameters are null. While the method functions correctly when at least one of the parameters is non-null, it does not handle the scenario where both are null as per the expected behavior.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   1. Run the portion of the script where "newArray" is defined and used.
   1. Invoke the method with both parameters set to null.
   1. Observe the method's behavior, especially its error handling mechanism in this scenario.
1. **Expected Result:** The method should be robust enough to handle null parameter scenarios. Specifically, when both parameters are null, the method should throw an **IllegalArgumentException**, indicating improper or invalid input.
1. **Actual Result:** Currently, when both parameters are null, the method does not throw an **IllegalArgumentException**. This deviates from the expected behavior, potentially leading to unintended consequences or errors in the script's logic downstream.
