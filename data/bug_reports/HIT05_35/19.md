1. **Description:** The issue relates to the conditional clause at line 3288, where the **type** variable is set to **Object.class**. This setting is significant because it influences the behavior of the **copyArrayGrow1** method invoked on line 3290. **copyArrayGrow1** returns an Object array based on the **type** variable's value. However, there is a subsequent attempt to cast this Object array to a String array, leading to a type mismatch and the failure observed in the script.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   1. Execute the script up to line 3288, focusing on the conditional clause and the setting of the **type** variable.
   1. Verify that the **type** variable is set to **Object.class** in the given conditions.
   1. Follow the execution to line 3290 where **copyArrayGrow1** is invoked and observe the type of array it returns.
   1. Note the attempted cast of the Object array to a String array and any resulting errors.
1. **Expected Result:** The conditional clause should set the **type** variable in a way that aligns with the expected type for **copyArrayGrow1**. If a String array is anticipated, the **type** variable should be set accordingly to ensure compatibility and prevent casting errors.
1. **Actual Result:** The **type** variable is set to **Object.class**, leading **copyArrayGrow1** to return an Object array. This results in a type mismatch when the script attempts to cast this Object array to a String array at line 3290, causing the observed failure.
