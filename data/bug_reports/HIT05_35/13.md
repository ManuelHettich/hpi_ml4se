·  **Description:** The issue pertains to the use of the **getClass** method at line 3288 in the context of handling a **List<String>**. The script attempts to convert an object of type **List<String>** into **List<Object[]>**, which is fundamentally incompatible due to type differences. The specific problem occurs when **listObj.add()** is called, which adds an element to the list. This addition seems to assume a different type than **List<String>**, leading to a type mismatch and potential failure.

·  **Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Execute the script up to line 3288, focusing on the **getClass** method invocation.
1. Observe the type of object being handled (i.e., **List<String>**) and how the script attempts to treat or convert it.
1. Pay attention to the behavior of the script when adding an element to **listObj**, especially in terms of type compatibility.

·  **Expected Result:** The script should handle the **List<String>** type appropriately, respecting its type constraints. Any conversion or manipulation of this list should maintain type compatibility, avoiding attempts to convert it into a fundamentally different type like **List<Object[]>**.

·  **Actual Result:** The script incorrectly attempts to convert or treat a **List<String>** as a **List<Object[]>**, particularly evident during the addition of elements with **listObj.add()**. This results in a type mismatch, which is likely to cause errors or exceptions, given the strict type system of Java.
