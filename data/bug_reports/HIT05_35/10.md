·  **Description:** The issue seems to center around the variable "type" and how it is determined in the script. The current implementation appears to infer "type" based on the **getClass()** method of either the array or the element, which is problematic. Instead, "type" should be directly inferred from the template argument types. The array is expected to be of the type specified by these template arguments, not based on the runtime class of the array or element. This discrepancy leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual type of the array.

·  **Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Review the part of the script where "type" is defined and used, particularly noting how its value is determined.
1. Examine the relationship between "type" and the template argument types, as well as the use of **getClass()** in this context.
1. Consider the implications of this setup on the type consistency of the array created or manipulated in the script.

·  **Expected Result:** "Type" should be inferred directly from the template argument types, ensuring that arrays or other data structures are created or manipulated according to these specified types. This approach should maintain type consistency and prevent any issues related to type mismatches.

·  **Actual Result:** Currently, "type" is being inferred incorrectly, potentially using the **getClass()** method of the array or element. This results in the creation or manipulation of arrays that do not match the intended template argument types, leading to type inconsistency and potential errors in the script's logic.
