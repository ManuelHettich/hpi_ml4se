·  **Description:** The issue centers around the conditional clause at line 3288, where a string element, which is null, is being evaluated. Due to the element being null, the conditional clause is defaulting to set the type to **Object.class**. This behavior might be causing a type mismatch or an unexpected result, as the script seems to be designed to handle a string but instead encounters **Object.class** due to the null condition.

·  **Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Execute the script up to line 3288, focusing on the conditional clause.
1. Observe the handling of the string element, particularly when it is null.
1. Note the outcome of the conditional clause, especially the assignment to **Object.class** in the null case.

·  **Expected Result:** The conditional clause should handle null elements appropriately, either by maintaining type consistency or by implementing an alternative logic that accommodates null values without leading to type mismatches or unintended behaviors.

·  **Actual Result:** When the string element is null, the conditional clause defaults to setting the type to **Object.class**, which may not align with the intended logic or type requirements of the script. This defaulting behavior could lead to errors or inconsistencies in the script's execution.
