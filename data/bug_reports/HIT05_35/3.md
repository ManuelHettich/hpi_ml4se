·  **Description:** There appears to be an issue with the **getClass** method invocation at line 3288, potentially related to a failure in casting an object to a string. The code is expected to output a string, but it seems to be outputting an object instead. This discrepancy indicates a problem in the type conversion process or in the handling of the object before attempting the cast to a string.

·  **Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Run the script **HIT05\_35**.
1. Reach the execution point at line 3288, where **getClass** is invoked, presumably as part of a process to convert or handle an object as a string.
1. Observe the output and behavior of the script, particularly focusing on the type of output generated and any errors or exceptions thrown during this process.

·  **Expected Result:** The script should successfully handle the object, converting or casting it to a string as intended. The output at this stage should be a string representation, aligning with the expected data type and format.

·  **Actual Result:** The script seems to be failing to convert an object to a string properly, resulting in the output being in the object form instead of a string. This behavior likely indicates an issue in the type casting process or a preceding error in how the object is handled or formatted before the cast.
