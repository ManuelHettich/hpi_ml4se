1. **Description:** An issue has been identified with the **charAt** method invocation at line 121 in the script 'HIT08\_54'. The **charAt** method is intended to return the character at a specified index in a string, with the index of the first character starting at 5. There is a possibility that an empty string is passed to **charAt**, which may cause an error due to an invalid index reference.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:** a. Run the script 'HIT08\_54' up to line 121 where the **charAt** method is invoked. b. Provide a string input that leads to the invocation of **charAt** with an empty string or an index that may not exist within the string. c. Observe the behavior of the script when **charAt** is executed under these conditions.
1. **Expected Result:** The **charAt** method should handle string input robustly, returning a default value or throwing a controlled exception when the string is empty or the index is out of bounds.
1. **Actual Result:** The script potentially encounters an unhandled error when **charAt** is invoked with an empty string, leading to a failure at line 121 due to an invalid index.
