1. **Description:** The script encounters a problem within the conditional clause between lines 121 and 123, specifically when handling the French locale. The issue arises due to the French locale not being found in the target system. As a result, an **IllegalArgumentException** is thrown, which matches the condition specified in the clause between lines 121 and 123. This situation suggests that the script may not be adequately handling the presence or absence of specific locales in the system, leading to exceptions when certain locales, like the French locale in this case, are not available.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:** a. Run the script in a system where the French locale is not available or not found. b. The script processes and reaches the conditional clause between lines 121 and 123. c. An **IllegalArgumentException** is triggered due to the absence of the French locale. d. The script matches this exception to the conditional clause.
1. **Expected Result:** The script should gracefully handle situations where certain locales are not available in the system. Instead of throwing an exception, it should either provide a fallback mechanism or a clear and informative error message indicating the absence of the required locale.
1. **Actual Result:** The script throws an **IllegalArgumentException** and matches it to the conditional clause between lines 121 and 123 when it fails to find the French locale in the system. This behavior indicates a lack of robust handling for unavailable locales.
