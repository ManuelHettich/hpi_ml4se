1. **Description:** The script 'HIT08\_54' is experiencing a validation issue in the conditional clause between lines 115 and 117. The problem arises when the script attempts to validate a country code containing '*P'. It appears that the presence of the underscore ('*') in the country code is causing the validation to fail.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:** a. Execute the script 'HIT08\_54'. b. Reach the conditional clause between lines 115 and 117. c. Observe the behavior of the script when it encounters a country code with '\_P'.
1. **Expected Result:** The script should correctly validate country codes, even if they contain underscores. Specifically, country codes with '\_P' should pass the validation process without issues.
1. **Actual Result:** Currently, the script fails to validate country codes that include an underscore, such as those containing '\_P'. This results in an erroneous rejection of valid country codes.
