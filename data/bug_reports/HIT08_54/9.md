·  **Description:** The script encounters an issue at line 103 related to the **charAt** method used for parsing the locale string. The variable **ch1** is hardcoded to extract the second character of the locale string, assuming it to be part of the language code. However, this approach does not account for valid locale formats that start with an underscore and do not specify a language code. In such cases, the second character represents the beginning of the country code, not the language code. Therefore, **ch1** incorrectly captures country code data instead of language code data, leading to a misinterpretation of the locale string.

·  **Steps to Reproduce:** a. Execute the script with a locale string that starts with an underscore and does not specify a language code (e.g., "\_US"). b. Observe the behavior of the script at line 103 where **ch1** is assigned the second character of the locale string. c. Note the incorrect assignment of the country code character to **ch1**.

·  **Expected Result:** The script should correctly parse locale strings, accommodating variations in format, including those that start with an underscore and do not specify a language code. The parsing logic should be able to distinguish between language and country code components accurately.

·  **Actual Result:** When provided with a locale string that begins with an underscore and lacks a language code, the script incorrectly assigns the first character of the country code to **ch1**. This results in an inaccurate interpretation of the locale string, as **ch1** is intended to capture language code data.
