1. **Description:** The issue is identified in the script **HIT08\_54**, specifically at line 113. The problem arises during the invocation of the **charAt** method. The **charAt** method is expected to access characters within a string, but it encounters a limitation due to insufficient string length.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   1. Execute the script **HIT08\_54**.
   1. Reach the execution point at line 113 where the **charAt** method is invoked.
   1. Observe the behavior of the method invocation.
1. **Expected Result:** The **charAt** method should successfully access the specified index within the string, provided that the index is within the bounds of the string length.
1. **Actual Result:** The script fails to execute as intended at line 113 due to an out-of-bounds error. The **charAt** method is attempting to access a character position (6th position) that does not exist within the string, as the string only contains up to 5 characters. Additionally, there is a mention of the absence of characters at positions 4 and 1, which may indicate further issues with string indexing or content.
