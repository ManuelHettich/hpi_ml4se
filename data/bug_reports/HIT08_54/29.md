1. **Description:** The issue occurs in the script **HIT08\_54**, particularly at line 124 involving multiple method invocations, including **Locale** and **substring**. The problem is identified with the third **substring** invocation (**str.substring(6)**), which results in a string of a single character "S". This substring's length is 1, which conflicts with the conditions in line 99 that require the string length to be equal to 2, 5, or not less than 7. This inconsistency leads to the script throwing an exception.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   1. Execute the script **HIT08\_54**.
   1. Proceed to line 124, where the **substring** method is invoked for the third time.
   1. Observe the behavior of the script when the resulting substring is of length 1, specifically containing the character "S".
1. **Expected Result:** The script should handle the substring's length appropriately, either by accommodating substrings of length 1 in its logic or by ensuring the substring length aligns with the expected conditions in line 99.
1. **Actual Result:** The script encounters an exception because the length of the substring generated at line 124 is 1, which does not meet any of the specified conditions in line 99. This suggests a mismatch in the script's logic regarding the handling of substring lengths and the associated conditions.
