1. **Description:** Upon review of the conditional clause between lines 118 and 125 in the script, it appears that the code is functioning as intended. The clause is designed to throw an **IllegalArgumentException** under specific conditions. Specifically, when the length of the string is 5 and the character string contains an underscore, the exception is correctly thrown. This behavior aligns with the intended functionality of the code, which is to identify and react to strings in an invalid format.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   1. Since the code is functioning as intended, the steps to reproduce simply involve executing the script with a string that meets the criteria for throwing an **IllegalArgumentException** (i.e., a string of length 5 containing an underscore).
1. **Expected Result:** The expected behavior of the script in this scenario is to correctly identify a string of length 5 with an underscore as invalid and to respond by throwing an **IllegalArgumentException**. This is a safeguard to ensure that only strings in a valid format are processed.
1. **Actual Result:** The script is performing correctly as per its design. When a string of length 5 containing an underscore is encountered, it throws an **IllegalArgumentException**, indicating that the string is in an invalid format. This matches the expected behavior and demonstrates that the conditional clause between lines 118 and 125 is functioning as intended.
