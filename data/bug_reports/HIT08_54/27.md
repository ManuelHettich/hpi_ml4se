1. **Description:** The issue occurs in the script **HIT08\_54**, specifically at line 121 with the invocation of the **charAt** method. This part of the script is designed to check if the character in the 5th position of a string is an underscore ('\_'). If the character at this position is not an underscore, the script is programmed to return an error, which could be the cause of the failure encountered in the test.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   1. Execute the script **HIT08\_54**.
   1. Arrive at the execution point at line 121, where the **charAt** method checks the character at the 5th position in a string.
   1. Observe the script’s response when the 5th character is not an underscore.
1. **Expected Result:** The script should correctly identify whether the character at the 5th position is an underscore or not. If it is not an underscore, the script should return the specified error as designed.
1. **Actual Result:** The script identifies that the character at the 5th position is not an underscore and returns an error as per its design. This behavior aligns with the error encountered in the test, suggesting that the issue might be due to either an unexpected character at this position or a potential misalignment in the script's error-handling logic.
