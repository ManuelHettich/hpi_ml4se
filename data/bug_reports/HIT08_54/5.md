1. **Description:** In the script, there is a potential issue with the use of the **charAt** method at line 114. The problem arises when the **charAt** method is invoked to access the fourth position (index 3) of a string. If the string passed as a parameter is of length 3 or less, the script attempts to access a character position that does not exist in the string. This results in an error, as the method call exceeds the bounds of the string.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:** a. Execute the script where the **charAt** method is used at line 114. b. Ensure that the string provided as a parameter to the **charAt** method is of length 3 or less. c. Observe the script's behavior as it attempts to access the fourth character of the string using **charAt(3)**.
1. **Expected Result:** The script should handle strings of various lengths appropriately without attempting to access character positions outside the bounds of the string. There should be a check to ensure the string length is sufficient before using the **charAt** method to access a specific character.
1. **Actual Result:** When a string of length 3 or less is passed to the **charAt** method at line 114, the script attempts to access a non-existent fourth character (index 3), leading to an out-of-bounds error. This issue causes the script to fail under these specific conditions.
