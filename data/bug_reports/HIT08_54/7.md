1. **Description:** The script encounters an issue at line 119 with the method invocations related to the **Locale** class and the **substring** method. The problem arises in handling cases where the country code is null. As per the referenced documentation and the issue described in the Apache JIRA link (LANG-328), the **Locale** class should allow a variant with just a language code or just a country code. However, the current implementation at line 119 does not accommodate scenarios where the country code is absent (e.g., "fr\_\_POSIX"), leading to an exception.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:** a. Run the script with a locale string that includes a language code and a variant but omits the country code (e.g., "fr\_\_POSIX"). b. Observe the script's behavior at line 119 where **Locale** and **substring** methods are invoked. c. Note the exception thrown due to the handling of the null country code.
1. **Expected Result:** The script should correctly handle locale strings that include only a language code and a variant, in accordance with the **Locale** class's specifications. This means gracefully handling cases where the country code portion of the string is null or empty.
1. **Actual Result:** When a locale string with a missing country code is processed at line 119, the script fails to handle this scenario correctly, leading to an exception. This indicates a lack of compliance with the **Locale** class's specifications regarding the handling of variants with just a language code or country code.
