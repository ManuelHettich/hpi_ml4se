1. **Description:** The issue arises in the script **HIT08\_54**, specifically at line 121 with the invocation of the **charAt** method. This method is designed to throw an exception if the character at the fifth position in the string does not equal "\_". In the scenario encountered, this string position contains a different character instead of an underscore, leading to the throwing of an exception and the failure of the script.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   1. Execute the script **HIT08\_54**.
   1. Reach the execution point at line 121 where the **charAt** method checks the fifth position in the string.
   1. Observe the script's behavior when it encounters a character other than "\_" at this position.
1. **Expected Result:** The script should ideally handle the scenario where the fifth position in the string is not an underscore. If this is a valid case, the script should not throw an exception but rather handle this condition appropriately.
1. **Actual Result:** The script fails and throws an exception at line 121 because the character at the fifth position in the string is not an underscore. This indicates that either the string's content is not as expected at this point in the script, or the script's logic to handle such scenarios is not correctly implemented.
