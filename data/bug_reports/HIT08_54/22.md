1. **Description:** The script encounters a problem at line 124 with the method invocations involving multiple **substring** calls, along with the **Locale** instantiation. The issue arises due to the script attempting to perform operations on up to six substrings, while the input provided only contains up to five substrings. This discrepancy leads to an error, as the script expects more information than is actually available in the input string.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:** a. Run the script with an input string that contains only up to five substrings. b. The script processes the input and reaches line 124, where multiple **substring** operations are performed. c. The script attempts to extract and handle more substrings than are present in the input. d. An error occurs due to the mismatch between expected and actual substrings.
1. **Expected Result:** The script should be able to handle input strings with varying numbers of substrings without encountering errors. It should either adjust its operations based on the actual number of substrings available or have a mechanism to handle cases where fewer substrings are provided than expected.
1. **Actual Result:** When the script processes an input string with only up to five substrings, it erroneously attempts operations based on the expectation of having six substrings. This leads to an error at line 124 due to the script's inability to handle the discrepancy.
