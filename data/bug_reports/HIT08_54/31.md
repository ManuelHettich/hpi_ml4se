1. **Description:** The issue occurs in the script **HIT08\_54**, specifically within the conditional clause between lines 107 and 126. While the exception is triggered by the conditional statement at line 115 due to a format violation, there is an additional issue at line 121. The script is designed to throw an exception if the string length is greater than 5 characters and the fifth character is not an underscore ("\_"). Given that the string in the test case meets these conditions, an exception is also thrown at line 121, contributing to the failure.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   1. Execute the script **HIT08\_54**.
   1. Input or simulate a scenario where the string length is greater than 5 characters and the fifth character is not an underscore.
   1. Observe the script's behavior, particularly at lines 115 and 121, in response to this input.
1. **Expected Result:** The script should accurately enforce the format rules for the string, including the proper handling of the fifth character when the string length exceeds 5 characters. If the fifth character is not an underscore, the script should throw an exception as part of its validation process.
1. **Actual Result:** The script behaves as designed by throwing exceptions at both lines 115 and 121. At line 115, it throws an exception due to a format violation in the string input, and at line 121, it throws another exception because the fifth character is not an underscore in a string longer than 5 characters. This dual occurrence of exceptions indicates that the input string does not conform to the expected format and character positioning requirements of the script.
