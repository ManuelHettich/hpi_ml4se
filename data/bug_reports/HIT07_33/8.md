**1. Description:** In the script "HIT07\_33", there is an identified issue with the use of the "array" variable, specifically when dereferencing its members. The problem occurs at line 910, where the script does not perform a null check before dereferencing **array[i]**. Given that the second member of the test input array is null, this oversight leads to a NullPointerException when attempting to access or manipulate this null element.

**2. Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Run the script "HIT07\_33".
1. Examine the for-loop, especially at line 910 where **array[i]** is dereferenced.
1. Note the absence of a null check for **array[i]** before dereferencing it.

**3. Expected Result:** The script should include a null check before dereferencing any member of the "array" variable. This check would ensure that null elements do not lead to exceptions when operations (like method calls) are performed on them.

**4. Actual Result:** The current implementation at line 910 lacks a null check before dereferencing **array[i]**. As a result, when the script encounters a null element in the array (specifically the second member in this case), it throws a NullPointerException.
