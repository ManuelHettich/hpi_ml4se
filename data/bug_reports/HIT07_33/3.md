**1. Description:** In the script "HIT07\_33", there is a critical issue at line 910 related to the method invocation of **getClass** within a loop. The problem occurs when the loop iterates through the dimensions of an Object, encountering null arrays in the process. Attempting to invoke **getClass** on these null array elements results in a NullPointerException. The suggested solution is to implement a null check at line 910, using a ternary operator to handle these cases. The revised code should be: **classes[i] = array[i] == null ? null : array[i].getClass();**.

**2. Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Execute the script "HIT07\_33".
1. Focus on the for-loop's execution at line 910, where **getClass()** is invoked on **array[i]**.
1. Notice that there is no check for null values in **array[i]** before invoking **getClass()**.

**3. Expected Result:** The script should include a conditional check at line 910 to handle null array elements. When **array[i]** is null, **classes[i]** should be set to null. If **array[i]** is not null, **classes[i]** should be assigned the value returned by **array[i].getClass()**.

**4. Actual Result:** The current implementation at line 910 does not account for null elements in the array. Consequently, when **getClass()** is called on a null element, a NullPointerException is thrown, leading to a failure in execution.
