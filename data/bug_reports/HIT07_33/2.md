**1. Description:** The script "HIT07\_33" exhibits a functional issue at line 910 during the execution of a for-loop. The problem lies in the method invocation of **getClass** without prior null-checking of the array elements. Specifically, the script fails to check if **array[i]** is null before invoking **getClass()**. The correct approach should be to first verify if **array[i]** is null and, based on this check, either set **classes[i]** to null or assign **classes[i]** the value returned by **array[i].getClass()**.

**2. Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Run the script "HIT07\_33".
1. Monitor the execution of the for-loop involving **array[i]** and **classes[i]**, particularly at line 910.
1. Observe the lack of a null-check for **array[i]** before the **getClass()** method is invoked.

**3. Expected Result:** The for-loop should include a condition to check if **array[i]** is null. If it is, **classes[i]** should be set to null. Otherwise, **classes[i]** should be assigned the class of the object returned by **array[i].getClass()**.

**4. Actual Result:** Currently, the script does not perform a null check on **array[i]** before invoking **getClass()**. This oversight can lead to a Null Pointer Exception if **array[i]** is null, as the **getClass()** method cannot be called on a null reference.
