**Description:** The script "HIT07\_33" demonstrates an issue at line 910 with the method invocation of **getClass**. The problem arises when **array[i]** is null, yet the script attempts to invoke **getClass()** on it. The correct approach should involve a conditional check to determine if **array[i]** is null. If **array[i]** is null, then **classes[i]** should be set to null without attempting to call **getClass()**. This change is essential to avoid a NullPointerException that occurs when trying to call a method on a null reference.

**2. Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Run the script "HIT07\_33".
1. Focus on the for-loop execution at line 910, particularly the **getClass()** method invocation.
1. Observe the lack of a conditional check for null values in **array[i]** before invoking **getClass()**.

**3. Expected Result:** The script should include a conditional check at line 910 to determine if **array[i]** is null. If **array[i]** is null, **classes[i]** should be set to null, thus avoiding a method call on a null reference. Otherwise, **classes[i]** should be assigned the value returned by **array[i].getClass()**.

**4. Actual Result:** Currently, the script does not include a null check for **array[i]** before invoking **getClass()**. This oversight leads to an attempt to call **getClass()** on a null reference, resulting in a NullPointerException.
