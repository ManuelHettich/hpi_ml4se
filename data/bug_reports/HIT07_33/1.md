**1. Description:** There appears to be a problem with the for-loop in the script "HIT07\_33", specifically between lines 909 and 911. The issue arises when the loop iterates and the index variable **i** reaches the value of 1. At this point, **array[i]** references a null value. Subsequently, attempting to call **getClass()** on this null reference leads to a Null Pointer Exception.

**2. Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Execute the script "HIT07\_33".
1. Allow the for-loop between lines 909 and 911 to run.
1. Observe the behavior when the index variable **i** is incremented to 1.
1. Note the occurrence of a Null Pointer Exception when **getClass()** is called on **array[i]**.

**3. Expected Result:** The for-loop should iterate over the array elements without encountering any null references. Calls to methods like **getClass()** on array elements should not result in exceptions, assuming all elements are properly initialized and non-null.

**4. Actual Result:** When the for-loop's index variable **i** becomes 1, **array[i]** is null. Consequently, calling **getClass()** on this null reference throws a Null Pointer Exception, indicating a failure in handling null values or an issue with the array's initialization.
