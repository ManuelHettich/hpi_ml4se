**. Description:** The script "HIT07\_33" contains an issue within the for-loop between lines 909 and 911, specifically related to the dereferencing of array members. The loop fails to check whether the elements of the array are null before attempting to dereference them. This oversight can lead to a NullPointerException when the loop encounters null elements in the array.

**2. Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Execute the script "HIT07\_33".
1. Focus on the for-loop between lines 909 and 911.
1. Observe that the loop dereferences each member of the array without first verifying if they are null.

**3. Expected Result:** The for-loop should include a check to determine if each element of the array, **array[i]**, is null before attempting any operations on it. This would prevent dereferencing null elements and avoid NullPointerExceptions.

**4. Actual Result:** In the current implementation, the for-loop indiscriminately dereferences elements of the array without null checks. As a result, when the loop encounters a null element in the array, it leads to a NullPointerException, contributing to the failure observed in the script.
