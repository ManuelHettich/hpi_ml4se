**Description:** The script "HIT07\_33" demonstrates a critical issue at line 910 involving the **getClass()** method invocation. The problem occurs when the method is invoked with null input values, as part of the input array **new Object[]{"Test", null, 99d}**. Specifically, when the for-loop iterates and encounters a null value within the array, calling **getClass()** on this null value leads to a NullPointerException.

**2. Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Run the script "HIT07\_33".
1. Observe the execution of the for-loop at line 910, especially when processing the input array **new Object[]{"Test", null, 99d}**.
1. Focus on the behavior of the script when it attempts to invoke **getClass()** on the null element within this array.

**3. Expected Result:** The script should include a mechanism to handle null values gracefully when invoking **getClass()**. This could be achieved through a conditional check before calling **getClass()**, ensuring that it is not invoked on null elements, thereby avoiding a NullPointerException.

**4. Actual Result:** In the current implementation, **getClass()** is called without checking for null elements within the input array. As a result, when the method is invoked on a null element (e.g., the second element of **new Object[]{"Test", null, 99d}**), it throws a NullPointerException.
