·  **Description:** In the script **HIT04\_7**, within the conditional clause spanning lines 298 to 310, there is a potential issue concerning the initialization of variables **e** and **s**. Specifically, the method **getDataItem** is being called with **this.minMiddleIndex** as a parameter for both variables. However, it appears that the correct parameter should be **this.maxMiddleIndex**. This incorrect parameter usage could lead to improper initialization of **e** and **s**, potentially impacting the script’s logic and contributing to the observed failure.

·  **Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Review the conditional clause between lines 298 and 310 in the script **HIT04\_7**.
1. Focus on the initialization lines for variables **e** and **s**, where **getDataItem** is invoked.
1. Note the use of **this.minMiddleIndex** as a parameter in these method calls.
1. Determine the impact of using **this.minMiddleIndex** instead of the presumably correct **this.maxMiddleIndex** on the script’s logic and outcomes.

·  **Expected Result:** The variables **e** and **s** should be initialized correctly, using the appropriate parameters in the **getDataItem** method calls. If **this.maxMiddleIndex** is the intended parameter, its use should ensure accurate data retrieval and processing in alignment with the script's logic.

·  **Actual Result:** Currently, in the script **HIT04\_7**, **this.minMiddleIndex** is being used as a parameter in the initialization of **e** and **s**, which may be incorrect. This likely results in improper initialization of these variables, affecting the script’s functionality and possibly leading to the failure observed.
