1. **Description:** In the script **HIT04\_7**, there appears to be an issue at line 299 where the methods **getTime**, **getStart**, **getPeriod**, and **getDataItem** are being invoked on an incorrect object. The current implementation uses **this.minMiddleIndex** for these method calls, whereas it should be using **this.maxMiddleIndex**. This misreference could lead to incorrect data being retrieved or processed, subsequently affecting the script's logic and potentially leading to the failure observed.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   1. Locate line 299 in the script **HIT04\_7**.
   1. Observe the method calls **getTime**, **getStart**, **getPeriod**, and **getDataItem** and note the object they are invoked on (**this.minMiddleIndex**).
   1. Identify the correct object that should be used for these method calls (**this.maxMiddleIndex**).
   1. Assess the impact of this incorrect object reference on the script's functionality and the calculation of relevant variables.
1. **Expected Result:** The methods **getTime**, **getStart**, **getPeriod**, and **getDataItem** should be invoked on the correct object, **this.maxMiddleIndex**, to ensure accurate data retrieval and processing. This alignment is crucial for the script to function as intended and to produce correct outcomes.
1. **Actual Result:** In the current implementation, the script **HIT04\_7** invokes these methods on **this.minMiddleIndex** at line 299, which is incorrect. This misreference likely leads to incorrect data being used in the script, contributing to the failure or unexpected results observed.
