1. **Description:** In the script **HIT04\_7**, there appears to be a potential issue with the use of the variable **e** in relation to the **getDataItem** function call. The problem arises due to the passing of **minMiddleIndex** to **getDataItem**, while the check is performed for **maxMiddleIndex**. This discrepancy in the index being passed versus the index being checked could lead to incorrect data handling or logic errors, especially in scenarios where **minMiddleIndex** and **maxMiddleIndex** hold different values.
1. **Steps to Reproduce:**
   1. Review the relevant portion of the script **HIT04\_7** where **getDataItem** is called.
   1. Identify the line where **getDataItem** is passed **minMiddleIndex** as a parameter.
   1. Analyze the logic to determine where and how **maxMiddleIndex** is being checked or used.
   1. Assess the impact of using **minMiddleIndex** instead of **maxMiddleIndex** in this context.
1. **Expected Result:** The appropriate index should be passed to **getDataItem** to ensure correct data retrieval and processing. If **maxMiddleIndex** is the index intended for checking, it should be consistently used in the **getDataItem** call to align with the intended logic of the script.
1. **Actual Result:** In the current implementation, there is a mismatch where **minMiddleIndex** is passed to **getDataItem**, but the checks and logic are seemingly designed for **maxMiddleIndex**. This inconsistency could result in erroneous behavior or data processing issues within the script.
