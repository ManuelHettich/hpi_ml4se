#### ***1. Description***
In the specified script, there is an inconsistency with the error handling associated with the variable "minutesOffSet". The script is expected to throw an exception if the "minutesOffSet" variable is less than -59. However, currently, it incorrectly throws an exception when the value is less than 0. This discrepancy leads to an incorrect range of acceptable values for "minutesOffSet".
#### ***2. Steps to Reproduce***
1. Navigate to the script indicated (HIT01\_8).
1. Observe the condition set for "minutesOffSet" on line 279.
1. Note that the exception is thrown for values < 0 rather than the correct condition of < -59.
#### ***3. Expected Result***
The correct behavior should be that the script allows "minutesOffSet" values ranging from -59 to the maximum defined limit, throwing an exception only if the value is less than -59.
#### ***4. Actual Result***
The script currently throws an exception for any "minutesOffSet" value less than 0, which is a more restrictive and incorrect condition. This issue affects the functionality, as it disallows valid "minutesOffSet" values between -59 and -1.
