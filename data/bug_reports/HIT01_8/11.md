#### ***1. Description***
The issue lies within the conditional clause between lines 279 and 281 of the script. The current implementation checks for "minutesOffset" being greater than 59 but fails to properly account for scenarios where the "hours" variable might be negative before rejecting negative "minutesOffset" values. While it correctly rejects "minutesOffset" values greater than 59, it should also include a more comprehensive check for negative values, potentially adjusting the condition to less than -59 rather than less than 0 to accommodate the acceptable range for negative offsets.
#### ***2. Steps to Reproduce***
1. Review the conditional clause between lines 279 and 281, focusing on the checks performed on "minutesOffset".
1. Consider scenarios where "hours" might be negative and how it relates to the acceptance of negative "minutesOffset" values.
1. Test the behavior by passing different "minutesOffset" values, including negative ones, and note the exception handling and acceptance criteria.
#### ***3. Expected Result***
The script should correctly handle "minutesOffset" by allowing an acceptable range of negative values, especially considering any relation to other variables like "hours". The conditional clause should reflect a comprehensive and correct check for both upper and lower bounds of "minutesOffset" values, potentially allowing values down to -59 or an appropriately defined lower limit.
#### ***4. Actual Result***
Currently, the script appears to neglect the proper handling of negative "minutesOffset" values in relation to "hours". It only checks for values greater than 59 and incorrectly rejects all negative values by using less than 0 as the condition. This leads to a restrictive and potentially incorrect rejection of valid negative "minutesOffset" values.
