#### ***1. Description***
The issue is identified within the conditional clause between lines 279 and 281 of the script. The clause is intended to validate the minute value, ensuring it falls within the range of -59 to +59 as per the comments in the code. However, the actual implementation erroneously checks for a value between 0 and 59, neglecting the lower bound of the specified range. This oversight means that all negative minute values, which should be valid as long as they are greater than -59, are incorrectly rejected.
#### ***2. Steps to Reproduce***
1. Locate the conditional clause between lines 279 and 281 in the script.
1. Review the logic implemented for validating the "minutes" value.
1. Test the behavior by passing various "minutes" values, including negative ones within the range of -59 to 0, and observe the validation results.
#### ***3. Expected Result***
The script should validate the "minutes" value correctly against the specified range of -59 to +59. Negative values down to -59 should be accepted as valid input, and the conditional clause should be adjusted to reflect this range accurately.
#### ***4. Actual Result***
The current implementation incorrectly checks for "minutes" values between 0 and 59 only, effectively omitting the acceptance of negative values that fall between -59 and -1. This results in valid negative minute values being improperly rejected, causing potential failures or unexpected behavior in the script.
