**1) Description**

The variable **hoursInMinutes** in the source code is calculated using the formula **hoursOffset\*60**. While the calculation itself is correct and an integer type is capable of holding negative numbers, there is an issue with the use or interpretation of the variable later in the code. The problem arises when the **hoursInMinutes** variable, which is expected to represent a single value, seems to be inappropriately handling or interpreting **Offset hours minutes** as having two values instead of one. This discrepancy leads to a failure in the code where it expects a singular value but encounters an array or a dual set of values.

**2) Steps to Reproduce**

1. Locate and open the source code where the **hoursInMinutes** variable is defined and used.
1. Review the calculation and subsequent use of **hoursInMinutes = hoursOffset\*60**.
1. Identify where **hoursInMinutes** is used or interpreted in the code and verify if it is being treated as a singular value or is mistakenly handled as an array or dual set of values.
1. Execute the code to observe the failure or discrepancy in the handling of **hoursInMinutes**.

**3) Expected Result**

The **hoursInMinutes** variable should be used consistently throughout the code as a singular value representing the total minutes offset based on the **hoursOffset** variable. All functions and operations that involve this variable should correctly interpret and handle it as a single integer value.

**4) Actual Result**

The **hoursInMinutes** variable appears to be causing a failure in the code due to a mismatch in the expected value type or count. It seems that at some point in the code, **hoursInMinutes** is being treated or expected to be more than just a singular integer value, potentially an array or a pair of values, leading to errors or unexpected behavior in the execution.
