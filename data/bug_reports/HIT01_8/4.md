**1) Description**

In the source code, there is a conditional clause between lines 279 and 281 that is causing an exception when the **minutesOffset** is less than 0. The issue arises specifically in the function call **DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(-2, -15)**, where **minutesOffset** is assigned a value of -15. The conditional clause is designed to prevent invalid minute offsets but does not accommodate negative values for **minutesOffset**, which are legitimate in certain contexts such as time zone calculations involving negative offsets.

**2) Steps to Reproduce**

1. Locate and open the source code, specifically between lines 279 and 281 where the conditional clause is implemented.
1. Review the function and its usage, particularly the conditional check related to **minutesOffset**.
1. Execute a function call with **DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(-2, -15)** or any scenario where **minutesOffset** is negative.
1. Observe the exception thrown due to the negative **minutesOffset** value.

**3) Expected Result**

The function should handle **minutesOffset** values, including negative ones, without throwing an exception, as negative offsets are a valid scenario in time calculations. The conditional clause should allow for a range of **minutesOffset** values that accommodate typical use cases, including negative offsets.

**4) Actual Result**

The code throws an exception when **minutesOffset** is less than 0, particularly demonstrated with the value of -15 in the function call **DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(-2, -15)**. This is due to the conditional clause between lines 279 and 281 not allowing for negative **minutesOffset** values, leading to a failure in scenarios where such values are legitimate and expected.
