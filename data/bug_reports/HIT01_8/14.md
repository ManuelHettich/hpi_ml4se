#### ***1. Description***
The issue pertains to the variable "minutesOffset" and its handling within an IF statement on line 279 of the script. Currently, the script is programmed to throw an exception if "minutesOffset" is less than 0 or greater than 59. This condition is problematic as it does not accommodate the acceptable negative range for "minutesOffset" as per the method's requirements or documentation. The correct condition should allow "minutesOffset" values between -59 and 59, inclusive, to correctly handle all valid minute offsets.
#### ***2. Steps to Reproduce***
1. Review the conditional statement on line 279 which evaluates the "minutesOffset" variable.
1. Pass varying "minutesOffset" values to the method, including negative values within the range of -59 to -1 and observe the behavior.
1. Note that the script erroneously throws an exception for any negative "minutesOffset" value.
#### ***3. Expected Result***
The conditional clause should be modified to "if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59)" to correctly encapsulate the acceptable range for "minutesOffset". This change would ensure that the method correctly progresses and invokes further methods as intended, without improperly throwing exceptions for valid negative minute offsets.
#### ***4. Actual Result***
The script currently throws an exception for any "minutesOffset" value less than 0, which incorrectly limits the acceptable range of minute offsets. This results in the script not functioning as intended for valid negative minute offsets and potentially affecting the progression and invocation of subsequent methods.
