**1) Description**

The issue identified pertains not to the **forOffsetMillis** method at line 294 but rather to an earlier portion of the code at line 279 in the static method **forOffsetHoursMinutes**. The problem arises from an incorrect conditional clause, specifically "if (minutesOffset < 0 || minutesOffset > 59)", which does not account for valid negative minute offsets. Instead of allowing for a broader range of negative values, the condition throws an **IllegalArgumentException** for any negative **minutesOffset**, a remnant from version 2.3 of the code. The correct condition should be "if (minutesOffset < -59 || minutesOffset > 59)". Consequently, the code execution fails before reaching line 294 or the method **forOffsetMillis**, as the exception is already thrown due to the inappropriate handling of negative minute offsets.

**2) Steps to Reproduce**

1. Locate and open the source code, specifically the static method **forOffsetHoursMinutes**.
1. Navigate to line 279 and observe the conditional check "if (minutesOffset < 0 || minutesOffset > 59)".
1. Execute a scenario where **minutesOffset** is a negative number, such as in the function call **DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(-2, -15)**.
1. Note the **IllegalArgumentException** thrown and observe that the execution never reaches the **forOffsetMillis** method at line 294 due to this early exception.

**3) Expected Result**

The method **forOffsetHoursMinutes** should accommodate a range of negative minute offsets, allowing values between -59 and 59, thus not throwing an exception for valid negative offsets. This would enable the code to proceed to subsequent methods, including **forOffsetMillis** without premature termination.

**4) Actual Result**

Due to the restrictive conditional clause "if (minutesOffset < 0 || minutesOffset > 59)" at line 279, the code throws an **IllegalArgumentException** for negative **minutesOffset** values and never reaches the **forOffsetMillis** method invocation at line 294. The error message "Minutes out of range..." indicates the exception arises from handling minute offsets, confirming the issue is with the handling of **minutesOffset** and not with the subsequent **forOffsetMillis** method.
