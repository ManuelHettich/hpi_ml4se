#### ***1. Description***
There is a flaw within the conditional clause between lines 279 and 281. The script is designed to reject any "offset" values less than 0 or greater than 59, throwing an exception in these cases. This causes a functional limitation as it improperly rejects a valid negative "offset" value (-15). This rejection is inconsistent with expected or acceptable range of values for "offset".
#### ***2. Steps to Reproduce***
1. Input a negative offset value (-15) within the relevant function or section of the script.
1. Observe the behavior between lines 279 and 281, where the conditional clause assesses the offset value.
1. Note that the script rejects this value and throws an exception due to the current conditions set.
#### ***3. Expected Result***
The script should allow negative offset values within a certain acceptable range (e.g., -59 to 59). The conditional clause should be adjusted to permit values like -15, only throwing an exception for values outside the acceptable range.
#### ***4. Actual Result***
Currently, the script rejects any offset value less than 0, including -15, and throws an exception. This limitation is due to the conditional clause between lines 279 and 281, which is improperly set to disallow any negative values, thus causing functional limitations and possible failures in scenarios where negative offset values are valid and expected.
