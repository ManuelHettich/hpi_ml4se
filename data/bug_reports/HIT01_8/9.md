#### ***1. Description***
The issue lies with the variable "minutesOffset" and its handling in the IF statement on line 279 of the script. The current logic incorrectly throws an exception for any negative value of "minutesOffset", which contradicts the documentation stating that "minutesOffset" can be negative under certain conditions. This discrepancy between the implemented logic and the documented functionality leads to unintended exceptions and potentially restricts valid input scenarios.
#### ***2. Steps to Reproduce***
1. Pass a negative value to the "minutesOffset" variable, which according to documentation should be acceptable in certain cases.
1. Observe the behavior on line 279 where the IF statement checks the value of "minutesOffset".
1. Note that the script throws an exception for any negative value of "minutesOffset".
#### ***3. Expected Result***
The script should allow negative values for "minutesOffset" as specified in the documentation, without throwing an exception, as long as those values fall within the documented acceptable range. The IF statement logic on line 279 should be corrected to reflect the documented behavior accurately and allow for the specified range of negative values.
#### ***4. Actual Result***
Currently, the script throws an exception for any negative value of "minutesOffset" due to the IF statement logic on line 279. This behavior is inconsistent with the documentation and restricts the functionality by not allowing valid negative values for "minutesOffset".
